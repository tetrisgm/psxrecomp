compile_overlays.py — Offline overlay compilation primitive (B-2 / A-2 shared path).

Reads overlay_captures.json, compiles each code overlay to a DLL, and writes
it to the cache directory.  The runtime's A-1 LoadLibrary path reads from the
same cache.

Usage:
  python3 tools/compile_overlays.py \\
      --captures  build-dev/overlay_captures.json \\
      --game-toml game.toml \\
      --recompiler psxrecomp/recompiler/build/psxrecomp-game.exe \\
      --runtime-include psxrecomp/runtime/include \\
      --out-dir   build-dev/cache

Each DLL is written to <out-dir>/<game-id>/<crc32hex>.dll.
Each DLL exports:
  overlay_init(dispatch_fn)  — call once after LoadLibrary to wire dispatch
  func_XXXXXXXX(CPUState*)   — one export per compiled function entry point

# Vigilante 8: 91 interiors, ~16k walked words each, per cycle). The memo records
# which (region_phys, interior_pc, region_crc) fragments have already failed so
# later cycles SKIP them instead of re-walking. Correctness is preserved:
#   - The key includes region_crc, so a DIFFERENT captured variant (different
#     bytes at the same PC) is NOT memoized — it re-attempts and can succeed.
#   - The memo file lives inside the cg<N>_<hash> cache dir, so ANY codegen/
#     contract/header change (which bumps the hash -> fresh dir -> fresh memo)
#     re-attempts everything (e.g. the psx_rfe_mark_escape contract fix).
