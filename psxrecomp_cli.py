    built by the previous toolchain.

    That is not theoretical: cmake-clang-v1 v1.0.10 shipped no sysroot and

    (glibc >= 2.38). v1.0.14 added a bundled older sysroot that exports no such
    symbol, and every build tree from before the upgrade failed to link with
    "undefined symbol: __isoc23_strtoul" while nothing looked out of date.

    Resolving the symlink puts the concrete version in the stamp, so the
