/* tex_pack.h — HD texture replacement / dumping (framework).
 *
 * A reusable psxrecomp feature: identify each texture the game uploads to VRAM
 * by content hash, so a high-resolution replacement image can be substituted at
 * draw time. The on-disk format is deliberately **identical to Beetle PSX HW's**
 * so existing packs authored for RetroArch are drop-in:
 *
 *     <disc dir>/<disc stem>-texture-replacements/<texhash>-<palhash>.png
 *     <disc dir>/<disc stem>-texture-dump/<texhash>-<palhash>.png
 *
 * where `texhash` is the CRC32 of the raw 16-bit VRAM words of the rectangle the
 * game uploaded via GP0(A0), and `palhash` is the CRC32 of the CLUT row the draw
 * samples it through. Both are lowercase `%x` (no zero padding). Compatibility
 * rests on three things matching Beetle exactly, all verified:
 *   - the polynomial (0xEDB88320, init/xorout 0xFFFFFFFF — crc32_compute);
 *   - the hashed byte range (the upload rect, row-major, X wrapped at 1024);
 *   - the rect a draw is matched against (the UV-limited sample rect, see
 *     tex_pack_on_textured_prim).
 *
 * Where this sits: uploads, fills, copies and textured draws are all observed
 * through the gr_* renderer facade (gpu_render.c), so tracking is
 * backend-agnostic — software, OpenGL and Vulkan feed the same tracker. This
 * mirrors how the [[vram_patch]] layer in text_xlate.cpp rides the GP0(A0)
 * completion hook.
 *
 * Lifetime model (v1): a tracked upload dies wholesale as soon as anything
 * overwrites any part of its rect. Beetle instead splits a partially-overwritten
 * rect into surviving subregions; that is deferred, and the dump-diff against a
 * Beetle dump of the same play session is what measures the cost.
