/* ABI version exported by every overlay DLL as `overlay_abi()`.  The loader
 * rejects (and deletes, so autocompile regenerates) any DLL whose version
 * doesn't match — including all pre-versioning DLLs, which lack the export.
 *
 * v2: dispatch call-contract (Bug D family) — DLL call sites carry (ra, sp)
 *     contract checks and share the runtime's bail state via the appended
 *     callback pointers below.
 * v3: widescreen backdrop screenX squash ([widescreen.backdrop] x_sites) —
 *     overlay backdrop handlers now emit psx_ws_backdrop_x() at their screenX
 *     store. This is an EMIT-content change (not a struct-ABI change), but the
 *     version is the cache discriminator: bumping it forces the loader to
 *     reject pre-backdrop DLLs so autocompile regenerates them with the squash.
 *     (The deferred follow-up is to auto-derive this tag from a hash of the
 *     widescreen config + emit headers; until then it's a manual bump.)
 * v4: widescreen backdrop column PRELOAD ([widescreen.cull] auto_backdrop) —
 *     overlay backdrop generators now emit psx_ws_backdrop_value() at the
 *     window START/END finalize, and the callback struct grows a
 *     ws_backdrop_value pointer (appended last). Bumping rejects pre-preload
 *     DLLs (which lack both the emit and a host that supplies the callback). */
/*   v5: psx_syscall callback return type void->int (CPS, RECURSION_BUG.md §25);
 *       overlays compiled under CPS emit `if (psx_syscall(...)) return;`. */
/*   v7: advance_cycles callback added; overlays now built with
 *       PSX_ENABLE_BLOCK_CYCLES and charge the shared host cycle/timer timeline.
 *       Bumping rejects stale DLLs that charged no cycles (Tomba2 Timer1 fork). */
/*   v8: check_interrupts_at callback added so generated native overlay block
 *       checks can provide the real guest resume PC for async RFE recovery.
 *   v9: faithful-timing callbacks (cyc_load, icache_fetch, muldiv, mult_latency,
 *       gte, slice_block) so overlay code built with PSX_ENABLE_BLOCK_CYCLES links
 *       against the runtime's real timing impls (the cycle-accuracy rearchitecture).
 *   v10: GTE special-register accessors (gte_read_data/gte_read_ctrl/
 *        gte_write_data/gte_write_ctrl) — the emitter emits direct calls for
 *        masked, aliased, read-only, precision-sensitive, flag/IR, and derived
 *        GTE regs; GTE-heavy overlays failed to LINK without shims (undefined
 *        gte_read_ctrl), silently blocking new coverage. */
/* v11 batches per-instruction cycle charges inside overlay DLLs and flushes at
 * block/device/store boundaries, removing a cross-DLL callback per instruction
 * without changing the shared guest-cycle timeline. */
/* v12: rfe_mark_escape callback — the emitter emits psx_rfe_mark_escape() at
 * every `rfe` (code_generator.cpp COP0 case), including in overlay-resident
 * exception-context code (Tomba kernel-window overlays hit this). It mutates
 * the runtime's shared RFE-pending escape state (interrupts.c), so the DLL
 * MUST forward — a local no-op would swallow exception returns. Without the
 * shim any rfe-containing overlay fails to LINK (undefined psx_rfe_mark_escape)
 * and that variant runs interpreted forever — the gte_read_ctrl class again. */
/* v13: ws_player_x_bound callback — the emitter rewrites a configured
 * [widescreen] signed_x_bound LUI site into psx_ws_player_x_bound(vanilla)
 * (code_generator.cpp; Einhander native-wide player bounds, 28165d6),
 * INCLUDING in overlay-resident code (the site loop runs in overlay_mode
 * too). The clamp computes against the host's live widescreen state (gpu.c),
 * so the DLL must forward; without the shim any shard containing a bound
 * site fails to LINK (undefined psx_ws_player_x_bound) and runs interpreted
 * forever — the rfe/gte_read_ctrl class again. Identity fallback (vanilla)
 * on a NULL host pointer keeps a v13 DLL correct (4:3) on an older host. */
/* v14: gte_precision_store_word forwarder — the emitter emits a direct call for
 *      every swc2 (GTE store-word); stateful runtime code (gte.cpp) so the DLL
 *      must forward or fail to LINK. Surfaced by full static overlay coverage
 *      (play-captured shards rarely compiled a swc2). Appended last; ABI bump
 *      to 14 rejects any pre-shim DLL. */
/* v15 histories existed independently on pre-integration branches:
 *      - generated stores call psx_store_cycle_barrier() before any host-visible
 *        write or SWL/SWR read-modify-write;
 *      - ws_depth_bound forwarder for configured aspect-scaled far-bound sites.
 *   v16: combines both ABI additions and rejects either stale v15 cache line. */
/* v17: ws_plane_nx forwarder for configured side frustum-plane normal-X
 *      cull sites. Appended last; NULL preserves the vanilla normal. */
/* v18: ws_xclip_bound forwarder for configured per-primitive X-reject
 *      bound-load cull sites. Appended last; NULL preserves the vanilla
 *      loaded value. */
/* v19: ws_cull_keep_result forwarder for full-word-guarded object/model
 *      participation comparisons. The verdict depends on the host's live
 *      widescreen margin; NULL preserves the vanilla comparison. */
/* v20: ws_aspect_cone_result forwarder for camera-horizontal, aspect-aware
 *      model participation with queue-safe guard/hysteresis policy. */
/* v21: ws_angle_widen forwarder for exact, aspect-scaled 12-bit terrain
 *      frustum half-angle constants. */
/* v22: gte_nclip_precise_bltz forwarder. Exact-NCLIP branches can be emitted
 *      inside runtime-patched overlay code as well as the main executable;
 *      without this callback those shards fail to link and stay interpreted. */

 *      table pointer (pgxp_hooks.h). Only pgxp-flavour shards (compiled with
 *      -DPSX_PGXP=1, PSX_OVERLAY_FLAVOR_PGXP set) reference the psx_pgxp_*
