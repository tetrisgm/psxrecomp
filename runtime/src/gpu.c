 *     offsets/widths itself — which our GTE X-squash never sees — so tagged
 *     prims get every X re-squashed around their own anchor at execution
 *     time, restoring correct proportions on the stretched present.
 *
 *  2. Untagged textured rects (SPRT family). These never went through the
 *     GTE at all (HUD, menus — pure screen space), so they're squashed
 *     around the display centre, presenting at native proportions.
 *     Untextured TILEs are never touched: full-screen fades/flashes must
 *     keep covering the whole frame.
 *
 * The tag table is keyed by the prim's guest address (the DMA linked-list
 * walk reports each word's source address) and stamped with the frame

/* ---- Capcom 2D background tile-loop widen ([widescreen.bg2d]) --------------
 * Mega Man X5/X6 use a pure-2D sprite engine that renders only a 4:3 (320px) field
 * of view — there is no overscan to "reveal." Its per-layer background renderer
 * (FUN_800270d0) draws `count` 16px tile columns × 16 rows from a start tile
 * column / start screen-x derived from the camera scroll. To produce a TRUE
 * wider FOV we widen that loop so it draws extra columns on BOTH sides of the
 * 320 view, filling the 16:9 reveal margins with real adjacent stage. The three
 * helpers below are hooked at the renderer's count / start-col / start-x
 * instructions by the recompiler (gen-time). They are IDENTITY unless native-
 * wide is engaged on a ~320 screen, so 4:3 (and the engine's own 512 hi-res
 * mode, which already draws 33 columns) stay byte-identical.
 *
 * LEFT = per-side reveal in whole 16px tile columns = ceil(nw_offset / 16). The
 * loop start moves LEFT columns earlier (tile col -LEFT in the 64-col ring,
 * screen-x -LEFT*16) and the count grows by 2*LEFT, so existing columns keep
 * their screen positions (stay aligned with objects/player) while new columns
 * are prepended left and appended right. The 64-column tile ring (mask 0x3f) is
 * far wider than the visible window, so the prepended columns fetch the correct
 * already-streamed adjacent tiles. */

/* ===== MMX6 BG tile-ring freshness fix ([widescreen.bg2d]) ================== *
 * The widened renderer (FUN_800270d0) draws LEFT extra tile columns on each side of
 * the 320 view, but the engine's streamer (FUN_800273e4 -> FUN_800274a0) only
 * refreshes ONE column per side per frame at the leading edge. On scene entry or
 * fast horizontal scroll the inner reveal columns therefore hold STALE tiles from a
 * previous scroll position (different scrollY) -> real-but-misplaced tiles spilling
 * up-and-left (the "staircase"). 4:3 is unaffected (it draws only the 21 columns the
 * engine keeps streamed). Fix: before the renderer draws, re-stream EVERY tile column
 * of the widened window for all 3 layers, so the render window and the ring-refresh
 * window are the same window. This is a faithful clone of FUN_800274a0's inner
 * metatile->ring fill, MINUS the scrollX wrap-bookkeeping writes (those drive the
 * engine's own incremental streamer; perturbing them would desync its leading edge).
 * Off-map columns fill tile 0 (the renderer skips them) = the engine's own void; at a
 * horizontal map-loop seam (engine early-return) we skip the column. Gated on
 * native-wide + ~320 mode, so 4:3 and the 512 hi-res title stay byte-identical. */

 * clips those for free; our GL path was building two triangles per clipped
 * prim (gpu_share ~0.9, host FPS ~5–10). Skip the host rasterizer when the
 * post-offset bbox cannot touch the draw area. Side effects that must still
 * run (texpage latch, oversize reject) happen before these checks.
 *
 * Native-wide is intentionally different in X: the mirror renderer translates
 * canonical framebuffer coordinates by the live reveal offset and scissors to
 * the FULL wide surface, not GP0(E3/E4)'s 4:3 X range. Commit 31015ce originally
 * compared every primitive only with the guest draw area here, rejecting the
 * margin geometry before the mirror renderer could see it. Match the mirror's
 * exact X extent while its framebuffer target is active; Y remains the guest
 * draw area because native-wide does not extend vertically. At 4:3, in FMV/
 * menus, in squash mode, and for offscreen texture targets, margin is zero and
 * this remains the original fast reject byte-for-byte.
 *
 * OpokXeno independently identified the same host-side regression on Xenogears
 * and contributed the original generalized fix in psxrecomp PR #73:
 * https://github.com/mstan/psxrecomp/pull/73
